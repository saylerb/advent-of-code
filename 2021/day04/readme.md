# Notes

- Probably didn't need to process the Bingo boards into a map,
  even though that makes it easier to lookup a specific drawing
- `Cell` could have been used more effectively, position of the number was not
  used
- For playing the game, shouldn't need two different methods
- Fix memoization of the the `hasWon` method
